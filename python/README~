SETTING UP POSTGRESSQL 
3. Start the postgres database server by running the command "sudo service postgresql start".
4. Change user by typing "su - postgres" in the shell
5. Enter a new password say <password>

RUNNING THE GRAIL CODE
4. Now inside the "Grail" directory, cd into the "Python" directory and run the code "Main.py" using the command "python Main.py" (assuming python has already been installed in the system).
5. Now copy and save the output of the python code for later execution.

EXECUTING THE GENERATED POSTGRESQL STATEMENTS
6. Open shell and start pgadmin3 by just typing "pgadmin3" and press enter.
7. In order to connect to the database server, use the following
        Name: localhost
        Host: localhost
        Port: 5432
        Maintanence DB: postgres
        UserName DB: postgres
        Password: <password>
